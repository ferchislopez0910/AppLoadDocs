# APP UPLOAD DOCUMENTS
This is a challenge where I create an app of the users can load differents documents for RRHH

## Description:
A mobile application is required in which documentation can be sent to Sophos through a cell phone, by capturing a photo of the document in order to support information such as disabilities, certificates, among others.
Additionally, the application will have geolocation to display the location of the company's offices on Google Maps for the delivery of face-to-face documentation.
